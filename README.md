Academic Project:

An automated Plant Watering system consists of a soil moisture sensor, a water pump, a water flow sensor, and an automated system. 

The soil moisture sensor senses the moisture content in the soil and if the moisture content is less, water will be pumped to the soil, once the soil has enough moisture level then the water flow stops.
